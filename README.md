# Project Bonuses

This project includes the following bonuses:

- Bonus Feature 1: [Server singleton] (real magshimim bonus)

- Bonus Feature 2: [Communicator singleton] (real magshimim bonus)

- Bonus Feature 3: [RequestHandlerFactory singleton] (real magshimim bonus)

(All 3 are singletons implemented in different ways!)

- Bonus Feature 4: [GUI states how many players are inside a room out of how many it can hold in the joinRoom page]

- Bonus Feature 5: [The active rooms in the joinRoom page in the GUI turn red]

- Bonus Feature 6: [The server doesn't allow the user to log into the same account from 2 clients at the same time]

- Bonus Feature 7: [In the joinRoom page in the GUI, if you selected a room and it doesn't get deleted after the automatic refresh your selection would stay]

- Bonus Feature 8: [In the room page in the GUI, the admin has their own label and is excluded from the normal players' list]

- Bonus Feature 9: [In the room page in the GUI, the player's name is red while the rest are white (even if they're the admin)]

- Bonus Feature 10: [In the GUI, you have to enter a valid email address to sign up]

- Bonus Feature 11: [The server detects client crashes and instead of crashing itself, prints a fitting message]

~~- Bonus Feature 12: [The client detects server crashes and instead of crashing itself, pops a fitting message box and closes the app automatically (which was super hard to do)]~~ Apparently, this is impossible to do, not just hard. ~~The code where I tried to do it is still included in the project if you'd like to look at it, since it doesn't change any functionality.~~ Nevermind, it makes everything not work. So this bonus doesn't exist essentially.

- Bonus Feature 13: [Cheat detection in the GUI: the users can't fetch the questions or the answers earlier than they should]

- Bonus Feature 14: [There is a page for adding questions into the database in the GUI] (real magshimim bonus)

- Bonus Feature 15: [You can't even CREATE a room that has more questions than what the server's database holds]
